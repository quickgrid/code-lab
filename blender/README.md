**TODO: Add instance segmentaion, object keypoint, orientation, 2d, 3d bounding box etc. Add images/video of the tasks.**

## Tips:

- Use blender python code with modal to prevent UI from locking up when running code.

## Blender Depth Map and Object Segmentation Mask:

Can be useful for deep learning. Enable `EEVEE` as `Render Engine`. In `View layer properties > Passes > Data` turn on `Mist`, from `viewport shading` dropdown in 3d viewport change `Render Pass` from `Combined` to `Mist`. Further control available under `Word Properties > Mist Pass`.

In the `Render Results` pop up window when `F12` is pressed, change from `Composite` to `View Layer`. Then change `combined` dropdown to mist. In next drop down `Color` will give a depth map and selecting `Z-buffer` will give object segmentation mask. Though this method will not differentiate different object types. 

If depth pass is used then it may be necessary to map range or use math. Cycles have far more passes in View Layer Properties compared to EEVEE including `Object Index`.

### Generating Multi Object Mask With Render Layers, Holdout and Compositing

Make a collection for each objects or each group of objects. Create multiple `View Layers` from drop down. From `Filters > Restriction Toggles` enable holdout. For each view layer select a collection and enable holdout. This will render each assigned collection in that view layer as transparent. From Compositing enable use nodes and get multiple render layers. For each of them select a different view layer. Add `File Output` and for it select right sidebar node properties. Add multiple inputs for it and from render layers output choose the image output or different passes. Each file output format can be controlled. For BW mask use `Color > BW` instead of RGBA.

Though doing all these will result in that object being rendered black. The trick to get a black and white segmentation mask for each object or object group is to use the alpha output from render layers. Connect it viewer and file output inputs. Rendering it will give black and white mask for each object groups.
