## Notes

Implementation of siamese network with triplet loss from, [FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf), paper.

Current implementation is tested on `MNIST`. `ResNet18` is backbone for transfer learning with training with extracted intermediate layers and layers frozen. A few linear layers are added with resnet 18 to generate embeddings.

This is an extension of [siamese network implementation](https://github.com/quickgrid/code-lab/blob/master/code-lab/pytorch/pytorch_siamese_network.py) I tried.

## Results




## TODO

- [ ] Test implementation on other types of dataset.
